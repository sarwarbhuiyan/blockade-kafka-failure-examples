# TEST RUN: beta-3 test run 2 16/03/2019

## Configuration
- 3 nodes
- Pika 0.12
- 1 quorum queue with rep-factor of 3 and Single Active Consumer enabled
- 1 publisher (max in flight at 200 msgs)
- 1 consumer (prefetch 10)

## Invariants tested
### Message loss
A  message is lost when publisher receives a confirm for it but consumer never gets it.

### Message order
Messages are received out-of-order if messages jump forwards then backwards then forwards.
For example:
1,2,5,6,3,4,7,8,9,10

Valid mis-ordering, according to AMQP are:
Messages can jump back and be duplicates, for example:

1,2,3,4,5,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Messages can jump forward only (this could indicate message loss but not an ordering issue):

1,2,3,4,8,9,10

## Log Analysis notes
11/20 test runs produced test failure

Message loss scenario related to consumers.
Messages delivered out-of-order, to investigate repro steps.

## Message loss investigation
The message loss always matches the prefetch and occurs 
in any chaos action that causes the consumer to lose 
its connection. On reconnection and consuming resumes,
those unacked messages are not redelivered.

Can easily reproduce using the scripts in this repo. Have
two terminal windows in the following folders:
- cluster (with virtualenmv activated)
- client

```
1. cluster$ cp blockade-files/blockade-rmq-3b-3.8.yml blockade.yml
2. cluster$ blockade up
3. cluster$ python create-quorum-queue-sac.py rabbitmq1 Test1 3 rabbitmq3
4. client$ python publish-sequence.py --queue Test1 --msgs 10000 --key 1 
```

before client has consumed all 10000 messages kill rabbitmq3
```
5a. client$ python ordering-consumer.py --queue Test1 --node rabbitmq3
5b cluster$ blockade kill rabbitmq3
```

You will now see the consumer connect to a different broker and jump 
ahead 11 messages (10 lost messages + next msg).

Sample output of consumer:
```
10:43:03.256974 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.2 : Sample msg: b'a=1400'  
10:43:03.700730 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.2 : Sample msg: b'a=1500'  
10:43:03.981889 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.2 : Connection was closed, retrying...
10:43:08.987545 : CONSUMER(1)->none : Connection is closed. Opening new connection
10:43:09.016501 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.4 : Consuming queue: Test1 with consumer tag: ctag1.b97a4c03de6c4f109a28f0c580d3f026
10:43:09.016960 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.4 : b'a=1558' Last-acked=1547 JUMP FORWARD 11  
10:43:09.171745 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.4 : Sample msg: b'a=1610'  
10:43:09.462396 : CONSUMER(1)->192.168.192.4 : Sample msg: b'a=1710'  
```

## Out-of-order delivery investigation
Characteristics:
- All out-of-order deliveries are messages with redelivered=true.
- Occurs when a broker is started bringing back quorum (bringing live broker count from 1 to 2)

The jumping back and forwards corresponds to the consumer prefetch.
Message ordering guarantees of redelivered messages are best effort only,
which is a shame. Was hoping that Single Active Consumer would enable
rock solid ordering guarantees.
